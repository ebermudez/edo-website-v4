## Product Management

Product Management is the discipline of guiding a product from conception to launch and beyond. It involves understanding customer needs, defining product vision and strategy, prioritizing features, and working closely with engineering, design, and other stakeholders to deliver value to users and the business.

A Product Manager (PM) acts as the bridge between business, technology, and user experience, ensuring that the right product is built at the right time for the right audience.

## Product Thinking

Product Thinking is a mindset and approach to building products that focuses on solving real problems for real users. It emphasizes understanding the "why" behind what you're building, not just the "what" or "how."

Key principles of product thinking include:
- Starting with user problems, not solutions
- Validating assumptions through experimentation
- Iterating based on feedback and data
- Balancing user needs with business goals
- Thinking in outcomes, not just outputs

## Agile

Agile is an iterative approach to software development and project management that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. Rather than following a rigid, linear plan, agile teams work in short cycles (sprints), deliver working software frequently, and adapt based on feedback.

Common agile frameworks include Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP). The core values are captured in the Agile Manifesto, which prioritizes individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.

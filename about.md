## About Me
![About Me](/assets/img/about-me.jpg)

I'm a Computer Engineer turned Product Manager. Explore my journey, projects, and ideas as I share my passion for the tech world and provide Product Management training/mentoring/coaching. Let's create something amazing together!

After getting a degree in computer engineering, I worked over 15 years in product management, software development, agile coaching, and project management with products for several industries, in several countries, and with multicultural teams. 

My experience involves every stage of software development, from startups to scale-ups and enterprises. I successfully led many product teams through product definition, workshops and training, coaching sessions, design thinking activities, discovery rounds, usability tests, and numerous agile ceremonies at the team and organizational level. 

Over the years, I noticed that members of a product team need more than their individual expertise, they also need to be able to work in an interdisciplinary manner in order to develop a product successfully. The interaction among them is what really shapes the product. Though, this part is often overlooked.
This inspired me to develop a practical way to learn how products are created, and now, I work independently as a Product Coach and Trainer, focusing on cross-functionality, clearer communication, and a healthier way of working together. 

In 2023 and 2024, I expanded my expertise by training to become an expert agile coach and a professional coach, receiving certifications from ICAgile and the ICF. This allows me to teach using solid techniques and support people’s growth in a structured and grounded way.

The aim of my company, [Sapiabox](https://sapiabox.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, is to bridge the space between engineering, product, and design so teams can develop products efficiently with the resources they already have. 

My job is to help software engineers, junior product managers, SaaS founders, and career changers entering IT roles (with or without experience) develop the skills that will help them move forward in their professional journey.
